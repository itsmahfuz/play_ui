    The sky turned a deep blue, the kind that only appears when the world is silent. In that moment, you became part of
    something you didn’t know you were looking for. The stillness you felt, the quiet inside—that’s the gift. The world
    is full of noise, but you found the calm. And that’s yours to keep, whenever you need it.
